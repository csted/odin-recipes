        <h3>Description</h3>
        <br>
        <p>It really is hard to beat a steaming bowl of spicy, smoky chilli con carne. Our simple chilli recipe, beautifully spiced with cumin and paprika, is simmered slowly to allow all of the rich, Mexican flavours to infuse.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 mixed peppers, diced</li>
            <li>500g beef mince</li>
            <li>1 tsp hot chilli powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato puree</li>
            <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>400g tin kidney beans, drained</li>
            <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
            <li>1 tsp worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large frying pan, heat the oil and fry the onion and peppers on a low heat for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the beef mince, break up and brown for 5 minutes. Add the chilli powder, cumin, paprika, tomato puree plus salt and pepper and mix until well combined. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, kidney beans, stock cube and Worcestershire sauce and mix well. Fill the tomato tin with water and add to the pan, mix well and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered for 1 hour, adding a little extra water if the mixture gets too dry.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once the chilli is cooked, serve with rice, soured cream and grated cheese.</li>
        </ol>
